      "InstructionsPreparation▢ To a bowl, add yogurt, ginger garlic paste, salt, garam masala, turmeric, lemon juice & red chili powder.▢ Mix up well and taste the marinade. Add more salt and spice if needed.▢ Make slits on the chicken pieces. Add it to the marinade & mix well. Cover and set aside for 1 hour to overnight. ▢ Rinse basmati rice thrice and soak for 30 mins. Drain to a colander after 30 mins.How to make Chicken Biryani▢ Heat ghee or oil in a pot or pressure cooker.▢ Add whole spices – bay leaf, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, shahi jeera & mace. Skip them if you do not have.▢ When the spices begin to sizzle, add onions & fry them evenly stirring often until uniformly light brown but not burnt.▢ Add chicken & saute until pale for 5 mins on a medium heat. ▢ Cover & cook on a low flame until the chicken is soft cooked or tender. Saute to evaporate any excess moisture in the pot. ▢ Taste test and add more salt if needed. Add yogurt (curd), half of the chopped mint leaves, slit green chili, red chili powder & garam masala.½ to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 green chili, ¼ cup plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon garam masalaLayering ▢ Mix everything well and layer chicken evenly at the bottom. (check video)▢ Spread drained rice in a layer over the chicken.▢ To a separate pot, pour water. If cooking in a pot use more water.▢ Add salt and mix. Taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Bring this to a rolling boil.▢ Pour 2 cups of this water across the sides of the cooker or pot. Gently pour the rest on top of the rice. (check video)▢ Level the rice if needed. Sprinkle the rest of the mint leaves. Optionally add fried onions & saffron soaked milk if using.▢ Pot method – If cooking in a pot, cover and cook on a medium flame until the rice in the chicken biryani is cooked completely but not mushy or undercooked. If the rice is still under cooked or hard & there is no water at the bottom, pour ¼ to ½ cup more boiling water depending on the kind of rice used and cook further. When done it has to be fully cooked, yet remain grainy but not mushy.▢ Cooker method – Set the flame to medium high. Cover & place the whistle. Cook until you hear 1 whistle. Move the cooker away from the burner to stop cooking further. ▢ Rest until the pressure drops naturally. Fluff up the chicken biryani with a fork. ▢ Serve from top to the bottom layer. Each serving gets biryani rice from top and chicken from the bottom layer. ▢ Enjoy chicken biryani with raita and sliced veggies, papad and shorba (biryani gravy).\n",

      "NotesWater: The amount of water to use depends on the brand of basmati rice. Not all basmati rice need the same amount of water. So for pot method, start with 3 cups water. Towards the end if the rice is undercooked, pour ¼ to ½ cup boiling water and cook further. You will need to experiment a bit with the right amount here.\n",
      "Tomatoes: An authentic biryani never uses tomatoes, so I have not used in the recipe. It does not add any taste infact alters the flavor. If you still want to use you an follow the second recipe I have posted below.\n",
      "To make biryani masala or garam masala – Powder together very small piece of nutmeg, 5 cardamoms, ½ tsp pepper, 5 cloves, 1 to 2 inch cinnamon, ½ tsp fennel seeds, ½ tsp stone flower.\n",
      "Yogurt or curd: Do not use sour curd. If the curd is slightly sour then skip using lemon juice.\n",
      "Rice: I have used lalquilla basmati rice, old malai. Any other basmati rice may need less or more water. Make sure to use as needed.\n",
